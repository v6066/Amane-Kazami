a story about Amane Kazami

Amane Kazami is a high school student trapped in a cycle of severe bullying. Seeking refuge in a deserted storage room, she attempts a ritual to summon a "God" from urban legends—not out of belief, but out of absolute desperation. To her shock, a grotesque, multi-eyed entity actually appears.

Key Themes:

    The Nature of "Gods": The entity clarifies that it isn't a divine being but a spiritual anomaly attracted to Mi's "interesting" nature. It represents a neutral force that offers a dark sort of protection.

    Revenge and Consequence: Instead of grand violence, the spirit inflicts a mundane yet effective "curse" (stomach aches) on the bullies, granting Mi a temporary window of freedom and a sense of agency she never had.

    The Burden of Loneliness: Mi lives in a dilapidated apartment, abandoned by her parents and society. Her willingness to accept a terrifying spirit—and even allow it to inhabit a tattered teddy bear—highlights that for her, a supernatural haunting is preferable to the cold void of human isolation.
